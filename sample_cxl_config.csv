# node_id,start,size,type,target
# This file is consumed by AddressMap (address_map_config) and is interpreted on *virtual* addresses.
# The node_id field is matched against the per-process node_id used by the simulator.
# For pool ranges, ensure the CXL buffer VA range is fixed per node_id.
#
# type: local | remote | pool
# target: destination node id (for remote/pool); ignored for local
#
# Example: map 1 MiB at 0x8000_0000 to a pool node (id 100), and 1 MiB at 0x9000_0000 to socket 7.
